# Sparse Coding Super-Resolution (ScSR)

Enhancing Single-Image Super-Resolution using Sparse Representations

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements single-image super-resolution (SISR) using sparse representation learning, building on the work of Yang et al. (2010). The method trains coupled high-resolution (HR) and low-resolution (LR) dictionaries to reconstruct high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts.

## Key Features

âœ… Sparse Coding-Based Super-Resolution using dictionary learning

âœ… Optimized Dictionary Training to speed up sparse representations

âœ… Deep Feature Extraction using ResNet18 instead of handcrafted features

âœ… Custom Blurring Techniques including Bilateral Filtering

âœ… Benchmarking against standard interpolation (bicubic) and other SR methods
