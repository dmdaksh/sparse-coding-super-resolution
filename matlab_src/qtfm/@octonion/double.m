error(['Conversion to double from octonion is not possible. ',...
       'Try cast(q, ''double'')'])

% Note: this function was replaced from version 0.9 with the convert
% function, because it is incorrect to provide a conversion function
% that returns an octonion result. The convert function provides the
% same functionality, but will not be called implicitly by Matlab to
% implement an assignment like X(1,2) = octonion(1,2,3,4) which gave
% erroneous results prior to version 0.9 and now raises an error.
% Convert was itself replaced with cast.
